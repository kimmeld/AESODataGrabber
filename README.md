# AESO Data Grabber

The [Alberta Electric System Operator](https://www.aeso.ca/) provides an [API](https://api.aeso.ca/) to retrieve data about Alberta's electric grid.  This is a small tool to gather data AESO that I'm interested in and store it in a PostgreSQL database.

# What data is collected?

Currently, I'm only collecting the generation data.

# Why?

Because I find this fascinating.  It makes for some really interesting graphs in Grafana.
